# Autoloader-Use-Case

Use Case
A legacy Telecom OSS (Operational Support System) processes network inventory, call detail records (CDRs), fault logs, and provisioning data. The data originates from various legacy systems, is stored in cloud storage, and needs to be processed into a modern data lakehouse for downstream analytics, fraud detection, and operational insights.

Medallion Architecture Overview
1️⃣ Bronze Layer – Raw Data Ingestion
Goal: Ingest data incrementally from legacy OSS sources and cloud storage while maintaining raw, unprocessed data.

Data Sources:

Network Inventory & Fault Logs → Batch dumps (CSV, JSON, XML) from legacy OSS.

Call Detail Records (CDRs) → High-frequency streaming data from mediation platforms.

Provisioning Requests → API logs ingested via event-driven streams.

Ingestion Methods:

Auto Loader (for network logs & inventory): Efficient incremental ingestion from S3/ADLS/GCS.

Kafka/Kinesis (for high-frequency CDR streaming): Near real-time event ingestion.

COPY INTO (for batch-driven provisioning reports): Periodic structured file ingestion.

Storage Format: Raw Delta Table (Append Only, No Transformations).

Schema Handling: Schema Evolution Enabled (as legacy OSS systems may introduce new attributes).

2️⃣ Silver Layer – Cleaned & Enriched Data
Goal: Deduplicate, clean, and standardize data for analytics and downstream applications.

Transformations:

CDR Deduplication → Remove duplicate call records from Kafka streams.

Data Standardization → Convert timestamps, normalize phone numbers.

Join Network Logs with Inventory → Enrich faults with asset details.

Storage Format: Delta Lake Table (Optimized for Queries, Stored in Parquet Format).

Schema Handling: Enforce strict schema validation (prevent unexpected schema drift).

Partitioning Strategy: Based on region, date, and network element ID for fast lookups.

3️⃣ Gold Layer – Business & Analytics-Ready Data
Goal: Provide aggregated, business-ready insights for fraud detection, SLA monitoring, and operational analytics.

Key Aggregations:

Network Fault KPIs → Number of incidents by site, region, and severity.

CDR Analytics → Identify fraud, dropped calls, and network congestion.

Provisioning SLA Metrics → Track delayed orders, service activations.

Data Consumption:

BI Dashboards (Tableau, Power BI, Databricks SQL) → For real-time monitoring.

ML Models for Fraud Detection → Detect anomalies in call behavior.

Data Sharing with OSS/BSS → Via Delta Sharing or APIs.

Data Lifecycle & Metrics
Stage	Technology Used	Ingestion Method	Schema Handling	Retention Policy	Metrics
Bronze	Auto Loader (Cloud Storage)	Incremental file ingestion	Schema Evolution	90 days (raw data retention)	File ingestion rate, schema drift occurrences
Bronze	Kafka/Kinesis (CDRs)	Streaming ingestion	Schema Evolution	30 days (high-frequency logs)	Streaming lag, event loss rate
Bronze	COPY INTO (Batch)	Periodic batch ingestion	Fixed Schema	180 days (historical structured files)	Batch ingestion success rate, data volume
Silver	Delta Lake	ETL processing	Strict Schema Validation	1 year	Data quality issues, duplicates removed
Gold	Delta Lake + BI Tools	Aggregation & Business Reporting	Fixed Schema	3+ years (historical trends)	Query performance, user adoption
Final Takeaways
Auto Loader excels for network logs & inventory ingestion from cloud storage.

Kafka/Kinesis ensures real-time CDR processing.

COPY INTO simplifies structured batch ingestion for provisioning data.

Medallion Architecture ensures data quality, scalability, and real-time analytics for telecom OSS.
